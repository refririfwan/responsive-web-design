                  <br>
                  <p>Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī (Persian: Muḥammad Khwārizmī محمد بن موسی خوارزمی‎; c. 780 – c. 850),
                      Arabized as al-Khwarizmi and formerly Latinized as Algorithmi, was a Persian polymath who produced
                      vastly influential works in mathematics, astronomy, and geography. Around 820 CE he was appointed as
                      the astronomer and head of the library of the House of Wisdom in Baghdad.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>Al-Khwarizmi's popularizing treatise on algebra (The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion
                      and Balancing, c. 813–833 CE) presented the first systematic solution of linear and quadratic
                      equations. One of his principal achievements in algebra was his demonstration of how to solve
                      quadratic equations by completing the square, for which he provided geometric justifications.Because
                      he was the first to treat algebra as an independent discipline and introduced the methods of
                      "reduction" and "balancing" (the transposition of subtracted terms to the other side of an equation,
                      that is, the cancellation of like terms on opposite sides of the equation), he has been described as
                      the father or founder of algebra. The term algebra itself comes from the title of his book (the word
                      al-jabr meaning "completion" or "rejoining").His name gave rise to the terms algorism and algorithm,
                      as well as Spanish and Portuguese terms algoritmo, and Spanish guarismo and Portuguese algarismo
                      meaning "digit". </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>In the 12th century, Latin translations of his textbook on arithmetic (Algorithmo de Numero Indorum)
                      which codified the various Indian numerals, introduced the decimal positional number system to the
                      Western world.The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing, translated into Latin
                      by Robert of Chester in 1145, was used until the sixteenth century as the principal mathematical
                      text-book of European universities.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>In addition to his best-known works, he revised Ptolemy's Geography, listing the longitudes and
                      latitudes of various cities and localities.He further produced a set of astronomical tables and
                      wrote about calendaric works, as well as the astrolabe and the sundial.He also made important
                      contributions to trigonometry, producing accurate sine and cosine tables, and the first table of
                      tangents.</p>

                  <br>
                  <p>Few details of al-Khwārizmī's life are known with certainty. He was born into a Persian family and
                      Ibn al-Nadim gives his birthplace as Khwarezm in Central Asia</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari gives his name as Muḥammad ibn Musá al-Khwārizmiyy al-Majūsiyy
                      al-Quṭrubbaliyy (محمد بن موسى الخوارزميّ المجوسـيّ القطربّـليّ‎). The epithet al-Qutrubbulli could
                      indicate he might instead have come from Qutrubbul (Qatrabbul), a viticulture district near Baghdad.
                      However, Rashed denies this:
                      <br>
                  <p class="fst-italic">
                      There is no need to be an expert on the period or a philologist to see that al-Tabari's second
                      citation should read "Muhammad ibn Mūsa al-Khwārizmī and al-Majūsi al-Qutrubbulli," and that there
                      are two people (al-Khwārizmī and al-Majūsi al-Qutrubbulli) between whom the letter wa [Arabic 'و‎'
                      for the conjunction 'and'] has been omitted in an early copy. This would not be worth mentioning if
                      a series of errors concerning the personality of al-Khwārizmī, occasionally even the origins of his
                      knowledge, had not been made. Recently, G.J. Toomer ... with naive confidence constructed an entire
                      fantasy on the error which cannot be denied the merit of amusing the reader.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  Regarding al-Khwārizmī's religion, Toomer writes:
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <p class="fst-italic">
                      Another epithet given to him by al-Ṭabarī, "al-Majūsī," would seem to indicate that he was an
                      adherent of the old Zoroastrian religion. This would still have been possible at that time for a man
                      of Iranian origin, but the pious preface to al-Khwārizmī's Algebra shows that he was an orthodox
                      Muslim, so al-Ṭabarī's epithet could mean no more than that his forebears, and perhaps he in his
                      youth, had been Zoroastrians.

                  <br>
                  <p>Al-Khwārizmī's contributions to mathematics, geography, astronomy, and cartography established the
                      basis for innovation in algebra and trigonometry. His systematic approach to solving linear and
                      quadratic equations led to algebra, a word derived from the title of his book on the subject, "The
                      Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing".</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                      On the Calculation with Hindu Numerals written about 820, was principally responsible for spreading
                      the Hindu–Arabic numeral system throughout the Middle East and Europe. It was translated into Latin
                      as Algoritmi de numero Indorum. Al-Khwārizmī, rendered as (Latin) Algoritmi, led to the term
                      "algorithm".
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                      Some of his work was based on Persian and Babylonian astronomy, Indian numbers, and Greek
                      mathematics.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>Al-Khwārizmī systematized and corrected Ptolemy's data for Africa and the Middle East. Another major
                      book was Kitab surat al-ard ("The Image of the Earth"; translated as Geography), presenting the
                      coordinates of places based on those in the Geography of Ptolemy but with improved values for the
                      Mediterranean Sea, Asia, and Africa.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                      He also wrote on mechanical devices like the astrolabe and sundial.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                      He assisted a project to determine the circumference of the Earth and in making a world map for
                      al-Ma'mun, the caliph, overseeing 70 geographers.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                      When, in the 12th century, his works spread to Europe through Latin translations, it had a profound
                      impact on the advance of mathematics in Europe.
